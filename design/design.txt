# First Level Generator

* Defines the general attributes of the level as well as the interconnected areas map
* Works by subdivision to fill the whole level.
* Places items and features on the areas, to solve simple puzzles.
* Defines the connections between levels

Example
  
{
	features:{
		mainEntrance: true,
		hasRiver: true,
		hasLava: true
	},
	areas: [
		{
			id: "c1",
			type: "cavern",
			x: 2,
			y: 3,
			w: 15,
			h: 20,
			items: ['shortSword', 'key', 'buckler'],
			stairsDown: true,
			stairsUp: false,
			bridges: [
				{
					x: 5,
					y: 18,
					to: {
						id: "c2",
						x: 5,
						y: 23
					} 
				}
			]

# Second Level Gen 
* Plots the level features into a grid (Rivers/Lava)
* Fills the areas, making sure its bridges are connected
    * For caves, area is seeded with a drunken digger path.
    * For rooms, one is placed within each bridge, then the area is filled with rooms, then they are randomly connected with nearby ones and every time a check is performed to see they are ALL connected
* Adds items to the rooms, making sure they are reachable
